    THE REGULARISED INERTIAL DEANâ€“KAWASAKI EQUATION:
    DISCONTINUOUS GALERKIN APPROXIMATION AND MODELLING
    FOR LOW-DENSITY REGIME; F. Cornalba & T. Shardlow

RIDK is a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) arising in the fluctuating hydrodynamics of intertial particles. RIDK-FD is a Python implementation for numerically simulating RIDK. It uses a discontinuous Galerkin approximation-in-space and semi-implicit Euler-Maruyama approximation-in-time. The main functionality for discontinuous Galerkin is provided by [Firedrake](https://firedrakeproject.org/).
